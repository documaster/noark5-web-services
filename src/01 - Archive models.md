Archive models
-------

## Overview

This page describes several archive *models* that are based on the *metamodel* defined in [Noark 5 version 4](https://www.arkivverket.no/forvaltning-og-utvikling/noark-standarden/noark-5/noark5-standarden). Note that more archive models may be **added to this specification** and **existing models may be updated**. Such changes will attempt to maintain **backwards-compatibility**.

By definition, Noark 5 systems must support at least one of these models and may mix models to allow for more flexible archiving. To archive into a Noark 5 system, you must first select (based on the task at hand) one or more of the archive models supported by the target system.

## Archive model 1

- Suitable for archiving documents that do not require grouping in folders or case files
- Suitable for archiving incoming/outgoing communication where the documents do not require grouping in folders
- Classification of records is optional but strongly recommended

## Archive model 2

- Suitable for archiving documents that require grouping in folders
  - Folders must be used wisely, e.g. to group documents related to the same project, person, etc.
  - **It is strongly discouraged to nest multiple levels of folders. Use classification instead!**
- Suitable for digitizing historic case files
- Classification is optional but strongly recommended
